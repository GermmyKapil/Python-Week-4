# File Handling & Exception Handling Assignment 🐍

## Overview
This project demonstrates **file handling** and **exception handling** in Python.  
It allows the user to input a filename, reads the file, modifies its content, and writes the result into a new file.  

The program is robust—it gracefully handles common errors like missing files, permission issues, or unexpected crashes.
